# Distilled-Decoding-2

This is the official repository of the paper "**Distilled Decoding 2: One-step Sampling of Image Auto-regressive Models with Conditional Score Distillation**" (**NeurIPS 2025**). Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2) provides a new method of tuning an image Auto-regressive (AR) model into an **one-step model**. 

We are still preparing the code and the arXiv version of the paper, and both will be released in the future.

We also recommend you check out our previous work "**Distilled Decoding 1: One-step Sampling of Image Auto-regressive Models with Flow Matching**" (**ICLR 2025**) ([code](https://github.com/imagination-research/distilled-decoding) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17153) [Website](https://imagination-research.github.io/distilled-decoding/)). If you are interested in our works, we warmly welcome citations and discussions!
